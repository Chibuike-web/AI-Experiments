# ðŸ“„ PDF Summarizer â€“ AI-Powered Document Summary Tool

**PDF Summarizer** is a web-based application that allows users to upload one or multiple PDF files, extract their content, and generate concise summaries using the **Google Gemini API**. The app is structured into separate pages for single and multiple file workflows to support learning and scalable design.

## âœ¨ Features

- Upload and process **single or multiple PDF files**
- Two dedicated pages:
  - One for **single PDF upload**
  - One for **multiple PDF muliple pdf uplaods**
- Extract raw text using server-side PDF parsing
- Summarize content via Gemini AI
- Display parsed content and summary side-by-side
- Clean, responsive UI with upload preview and progress states

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** â€“ Component-based UI
- **Vite** â€“ Fast, modern build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling for responsive design

### Backend

- **Node.js** â€“ JavaScript runtime for server logic
- **Express.js** â€“ RESTful API for text parsing and summarization
